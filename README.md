# Lecture Notes and homework will available here
Join our class on Zoom at 4 PM (CET) every Tuesday and Saturday by clicking this link: [https://cern.zoom.us/j/62851469905?pwd=cmN3afnGMla0e3h2vc90e3Zjs1tMJg.1](https://cern.zoom.us/j/62851469905?pwd=cmN3afnGMla0e3h2vc90e3Zjs1tMJg.1) to start or join a scheduled meeting.

This lecture series is designed to not only deepen your understanding of Nuclear and Particle Physics but also encourage you to think critically about the fundamental concepts that form the backbone of these fields. Our lectures will be interactive, and I encourage you to participate in discussions throughout the course. Together, we will shape the content in a way that ensures it remains engaging and enjoyable, making this an experience both you and I will enjoy as instructor and student.
## Nuclear and Particle Physics 
### Introduction 
In the introductory lecture, we will cover some of the fundamental concepts in Nuclear and Particle Physics. This lecture is crucial for establishing the foundation of the course, so I strongly recommend paying close attention. During this session, we will discuss the following topics:

- Fundamental Units of High Energy Physics  
- A Brief Introduction to Quantum Mechanics  
- Wave-Particle Duality  
- Harmonic Oscillators in Quantum Mechanics  
- Fields and Particles  
- Annihilation and Creation Operators  
- Relativistic Kinematics
